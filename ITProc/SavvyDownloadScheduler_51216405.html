                    <h3 id="SavvyDownloadScheduler-Purpose">Purpose</h3><p>This application allows scheduling of web downloads (FTP, HTTP, etc.) at set times or frequencies.</p><p>It currently downloads around 65,000 files per month as a result of around 150 jobs scheduled through the application.</p><h3 id="SavvyDownloadScheduler-TechnicalDetails">Technical Details</h3><p>This application is a SavvyPlus-developed console application written in Python.</p><p>It runs on MEL-SVR-AP-001 as a scheduled task and is designed to run continuously.</p><p>The application is located at E:\SavvyApps\SavvyDownloadScheduler\dist\SavvyDownloadScheduler and writes log files to E:\ApplicationLogs</p><p>Database connection string is set in config file SavvyDownloadScheduler.cfg</p><p>The application writes to and reads from the MarketData database. Configuration table is NEMWebFolders and file download records are stored in NEMWebFilesÂ </p><p>The application needs certificate file cacert.pem present in application folder to run successfully</p><h3 id="SavvyDownloadScheduler-Monitoringandtrouble-shooting">Monitoring and trouble-shooting</h3><p>There is indirect monitoring of this application via a SQL Server Agent job that runs each hour. If no files have been loaded by the SavvyDataLoader in the last hour then an email is sent to the SQLAdmin email list. If such an email is received then the SavvyDownloadScheduler not running correctly is one possible cause.</p><p>If the application is not successfully downloading files then re-starting the application is the only thing generally required.</p><p>For more advanced trouble-shooting consult the log file or run the application from a dos box to see error messages.</p><h3 id="SavvyDownloadScheduler-SchedulingDownloads">Scheduling Downloads</h3><p>If a new scheduled download is added or an existing one modified then the application needs to be re-started for the changes to take effect.</p><p>Download jobs are set up using table MarketData.dbo.NEMWebFolders. Parameters are as follows:</p><div class="table-wrap"><table class="confluenceTable"><colgroup><col/><col/></colgroup><tbody><tr><th class="confluenceTh">Parameter</th><th class="confluenceTh">Description</th></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd">URL</td><td class="confluenceTd">URL from which to download.

Files matching <em>filename_pattern</em> will be downloaded. Previously downloaded file names will be ignored.</p><p>DIRECT_FTP - Downloads the file at the named <em>URL</em> via FTP. The <em>URL</em> should include the full file name, and <em>filename_pattern</em> is used to determine the name of the file written at the destination.</p><p>LINKS_OVERWRITE - same as LINKS but will download all matching files irrespective of whether the same named file has previously been downloaded.</p><p>DIRECT - Downloads the file at the named <em>URL</em> via HTTP.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd">filename_pattern</td><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd">The file mask used to determine which links/files to download, or the pattern for the file name to save to (depending on <em>retrieval_type)</em>.
