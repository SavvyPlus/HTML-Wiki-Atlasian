It will target 60% of a customer’s DUOS charge to be recovered from demand tariff components. At this level approximately 75% of the calculated LRMC of demand is being recovered from demand tariff components, with the residual revenue being recovered through an anytime energy tariff component. Demand tariff components will be recovered on a $/kW basis.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Low voltage small business customers</strong></p><p>In accordance with UE’s Revised TSS, as endorsed by the AER on the 26th August 2016, eligible customers will transition to a new tariff with a demand component (LVMKW1R) on 1 st January 2017.</p><p>This initial step will target 25% of a customer’s DUOS charge to be recovered from demand tariff components with a subsequent step up to 50% (of DUOS from demand) from 2019.</p><p>This level approximates the calculated LRMC of demand with the residual revenue being recovered through an anytime energy tariff. Demand tariff components will be recovered on a $/kW basis. LVMKWTOU continues to be available for customers seeking to “opt in” to a fully cost reflective tariff (i.e.50% of DUoS from demand).</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>NEW TARIFFS</strong></p><div class="table-wrap"><table class="relative-table wrapped confluenceTable" style="width: 1456.0px;"><colgroup><col style="width: 0.0px;"/><col style="width: 0.0px;"/><col style="width: 0.0px;"/><col style="width: 0.0px;"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th class="highlight-yellow confluenceTh" colspan="1" data-highlight-colour="yellow"><div class="tablesorter-header-inner">Tariff Code</div></th><th class="highlight-yellow confluenceTh" data-highlight-colour="yellow"><div class="tablesorter-header-inner">Name</div></th><th class="highlight-yellow confluenceTh" data-highlight-colour="yellow"><div class="tablesorter-header-inner">Eligibility</div></th><th class="highlight-yellow confluenceTh" data-highlight-colour="yellow"><div class="tablesorter-header-inner">Structure &amp; Suitability</div></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd">LVMKW1R</td><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd">Low Voltage Medium kW 1 rate (Mandatory)</td><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd">Available to low voltage business customers with energy consumption between 40 - 400MWh per annum.
